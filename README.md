# Merinalt Nudegon

Welcome to the MerinaltNudegon repository! 

Here you can find the source code for the web game Merinalt Nudegon, a terminal dungeon where the only way to interact with the game is through commands!

I know this game design is very out of date, but after playing Zork, a terminal dungeon from the 70s, I was fascinated with the idea of creating a interactive world entirely understood through text. 
Now, without further ado, I will explain some core mechanics of the Merinalt Nudegon.

## Commands

Merinalt Nudegon offers a wide variety of commands. Part of the game is learning how to use the commands, much like you would learn to interact with the real world. 
I wanted to give users the opportunity to learn by playing rather than play by learning. There are a few commands that I will explicitly explain the syntax for as they are the most essential for playing.

| Command                      | Syntax                  | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| help                         | help                    | Helps the player with basic commands.                                             |
| pick/grab                    | pick up/grab item       | Picks up an item that is in the current room.                                     |
| go/walk/run/travel/head/move | go direction            | Moves the player in the direction specified if there is a room in that direction. |
| fight/attack/hit/slash/stab  | fight enemy with weapon | Attacks enemies with the weapon specified.                                        |

## Status

The game is currently in early beta. I am focusing on polishing mechanics to make later development easier while avoiding redundancy.
